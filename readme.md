## Running the code

The code uses `cmake` as a build system. Run the following commands in the terminal to build and run the project:

```
> cmake -B build    # under the directory where the CMakeLists.txt is located
> make -C build
> ./tpSubdiv        
```

## Controls

### Keyboard commands:
- H: print this help
- P: toggle simulation
- G: toggle grid rendering
- V: toggle velocity rendering
- S: save current frame into a file
- Q: quit the program
